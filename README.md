# NetBSD modular userland
You can update NetBSD userland partly using an apt/yum like utility.

It composed of a client utility (reference implementation) and the corresponding server side.
The formar is "nbpkg", the latter is "nbpkg-build".

Currently, plan A works well but plan A is weird. So we will develop Plan B inspired by Onodera (ryoon@netbsd.org).
